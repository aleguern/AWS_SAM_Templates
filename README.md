# AWS SAM Templates

I often found myself using the same patterns with AWS SAM over and over. This is a list of my favorite patterns.

List:

- [Image recognition (S3, lambda, DynamoDB, Rekognition)](/rekognition/)
- [GraphQL API (AppSync, DynamoDB, VTL)](/graphqlAPI/)
- [GraphQL API with real-time data (AppSync, DynamoDB, Lambda, JS)](/subscriptionGraphqlAPI/)
- [Orchestration pattern with async hook (Stepfunction, API Gateway, Lambda)](/orchestration/)
